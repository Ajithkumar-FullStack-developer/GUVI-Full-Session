**HTTP1.1 and HTTP2**
    HTTP- as a Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    The protocol that govern how the information is transmitted between server and cilent.
 
    Different between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

 **HTTP1.1 While revolutionary at the time,
         HTTP/1.1 has certain limitations that become more apparent as web applications grow in complexity and size.

    HTTP1.1 Key Characteristics 

        1. sequentail Request
            Each request and response is handling sequentailly, like a HTML and CSS,
            it must establish multiple connections, leading to potential inefficiencies.
        2. Compression
            it must support Compression of response data like a ZIP,
            it can lead additional overhead and dealing with large number of small resource
        3. No Multiplexing
            This is one of the biggest limitation of HTTP11.1 
            and its lacks the multiplex multiple request and response over th single (TCP) connections
        4. Header Overhead
            This redundancy can consume bandwidth unnecessarily, especially for small requests.
 **HTTP2 It aims to address these shortcomings while maintaining compatibility with existing web infrastructure.
          developed and standardized by the IETF in 2015.
    HTTP2 Key improvements

        1. Multiplexing
            Its allows multiple request and multiple response, send and received concurrently over single TCP connection.
            This significantly reduces latency and improves page load times, especially on complex websites.
        2.Header Compression
            This helps conserve bandwidth and speeds up data transmission and particularly beneficial for mobile users.
        3. Binary Protocol
            HTTP2 is Binary protocol 
            This simplifies parsing, reduces errors, and improves performance.
        4. Server Push
            This allows servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are explicitly requested.
