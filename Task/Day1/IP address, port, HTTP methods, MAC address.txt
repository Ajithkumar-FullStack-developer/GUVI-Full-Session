**IP Addresses, ports, HTTP Menthods, and MAC Addresses**
        Networking is a foundational aspect of modern computing, enabling devices to communicate and share resources.
        Key concepts in this realm include IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, and MAC addresses

    *IP Addresses (Internal Protocol)
            its unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network.
            It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over the internet,
            and local network.
        Types of IP Addresses
          1.IPv4: Are 32-bit numbers it is represented in the decimal format
            as four octets separated by dot (192.654.6.8)
          2.IPv6: Are 128-bit addresses and its is represented hexadecimal format 
            and its separated by colons (2002:0dh9:85k4:0000:ect,...)
    *Port
            It is a logical construct that identifies a specific process.
            Combination with an IP address to manage multiple connections simultaneously.
        They are categorized by
               Well-Known Ports (0-1023)
                Registered Ports (1024-49151)
                Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-650535)
        when it has default port is (HTTP is 80) (HTTPS is 443)
    
    *HTTP methods (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
            In this methods are actions that indicate the desired action to be performed on a given resource.
            These methods, also known as HTTP verbs
        HTTP Verbs
            1. GET-Retrieve the data from a server.
            2. POS-Send data to the srver to create a new resource. 
            3. PUT-Updateing the existing resource.
            4. DELETE-Remove the resource from the server.
            5. PATCH-Apply partial modification to resource.
    *MAC Address(Media Access control)
           MAC address is a hardware identifier that uniquely identifies each device on a network.
           it is composed six groups two hexadecimal digits and separated by colon or hyphen
           Example: (00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
        USAGE
            used in the data link layer of the OSI model.
            its ensuring the data delivered to the correct hardware device.
